Hi Mehdi,

Thank you for following up, I have been thinking hard on this one.

As we have established, this is really a clash between multiple things that I am looking for: First being technology challenge, and second being work independence (remote, flexible work).

I can undoubtedly see technology challenge in there, and I feel happy to be considered as a tech co-founder with such an A-class team. There is no better way of saying this, but I am prioritizing my work independence over other things, and would have to step down from the candidacy of a tech co-founder.

Having said that, I am very willing and interested to be part of Urban Chefs in every way I can, including and not exhaustive to:
- Helping find a tech co-founder: I have a few references, I can check with them
- Helping with solid, industry-grade, high-performance development of modules and applications on a remote basis: I am really good at this, and it will be very useful even for the kind of startup you're going for, as programming before launch need not be time-bound, and even enhancements and data analysis after.
- Any other way you would need me

Please let me know anytime I can be of any assistance, considering my requirements.
I'm sure you will achieve the mission you set out for.

Best regards,
Riten Vagadiya
